The features that contain very little new information are dropped until the most varied (and therefore, most descriptive) information is all that remains.\n",

    "Unlike the first two methods, Isomap Embedding takes a non-linear approach to dimensionality reduction.  The method begins with KNearest Neighbors, then constructs a \"neighborhood graph\" by connecting each point to its nearest neighbors.  Then the geodesic distance (NOT the Euclidean distance used by linear approaches) is calculated as the shortest distance between each pair of points by traveling through the neighborhood connections in the neighborhood graph.  This provides a much more vivid description of the relationships between points than calculating Euclidean distance would.  Then the dimensions of the input matrix are able to be greatly reduced while preserving the non-linear relationships between these neighborhood clusters of data.\n",
